## How it works
It finds if the number from the list is closer to the minimum of the list or the maximum. If it's closer the minimum, the number 1 is added to the list "y". If it's closer to maximum, the number 0 is added to the list "y". So, the first number in the list "X" corresponds to the first number in list "y". The second number in the list "X" corresponds to the second number in the list "y", and so on.
